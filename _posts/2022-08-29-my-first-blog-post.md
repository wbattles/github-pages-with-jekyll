Hello, darlin'
Nice to see you
It's been a long time
You're just as lovely as you used to be.

How's your new love?
Are you happy?
Hope you're doin' fine
Just to know it means so much to me.

What's that, darlin'?
How am I doin'?
I'm doin' alright
Except I can't sleep and I cry all night 'til dawn.

What I'm trying to say
Is I love you
And I miss you
And I'm so sorry that I did you wrong.

Look up, darlin'
Let me kiss you
Just for old time's sake
Let me hold you in my arms one more time.

Thank you, darlin'
May God bless you
And each step you take
Bring you closer to the things you seek to find.

Goodbye, darlin'
I gotta go now
Gotta try to find a way
To lose these memories of a love so warm and true.

And if you should ever find it
In your heart to forgive me
Come back, darlin'
I'll be waitin' for you...
